# SmartRefrigerator

Name: - Smart Refrigerator	Health	Tracker.
Domain: - Health	Care.
Description: - The	idea	of	the	proposal	is	to	monitor	the	people’s	health	by	gathering	the	data	
of	their	daily	food	consumption.	Based	on	the	eating	habits	of	people	we	can	find	out	the	
health	status	of	individuals	and	scale	them	up	till	the	entire	ecosystem.	We	are	using	the	latest	
technological	revolution	‘Internet	of	Things’	for	implementation.
Scope: - With	the	increase	in	health	awareness	among	the	people, we	decide	to	use	technology	
to	go	a	step	further	and	give people	real	time in-depth knowledge	about	their	health.
In	this	project	we	are	going	to
1) Intelligent	refrigerator gives their	master	the	real	time	tracking	of	the	food	that	are	
stored	inside	it. This	includes various	attributes	like amount	of	the	food	present,	
ingredients	of	all	the	food, its	expiry	date etc.
2) Home	Intelligent	Refrigerator	will	notify	its	master	when	the	food store	inside is	about	
to	finish	and	at	the	same	time	will	ask	for its	availability and	offers	associated to	the	
Intelligent	Store	Refrigerator	placed	at various	local	stores. Local	store	in	return	will	
send	the	Home	Refrigerator	the	details	it has	requested	for	and even place	an	order
3) Store	refrigerator	keeps	track	of	all	the	food	it	contains,	their	attributes	(price,	
availability,	expiration,	offer etc.),	food	that	sold,	food	that	expired	etc.
4) With	this intelligence	we	can understand	the	eating	habits	of	people	and track	their
health	at	different	levels	of	ecosystem.	Intelligent	refrigerator at	each house	and	store
will	monitor	the	food	consumption and	send	that data	to	the local healthcare	center.	
Based	on	the	data	received	healthcare	center	will	then	analyze	the	data	and	give	the	
detailed	reports.
5) Reports	are	personalized by	keeping	the track	of health	record	of every	family	gene.	
Based	on	this	information healthcare	will	send House	Intelligent	Refrigerator	the
suggested	amount	of	ingredients	to	be	consumed,	health-life indicator,	disease (if	any)
they	are	prone	to,	and	reason	for	the	disease.
Conclusion: This	project	benefits	three
A) The	people	in	the	community for	they	can	monitor	their	health	and	ease the	
burden	of	managing	the	daily	chorus.
B) The	Health	Care	Center for	they	can	keep	track	of	health	and	use	this
obtained	data	for	various	analysis.
C) The	store for	they	can	optimize	their	sale	and	manage	their	inventory more	
effectively
